model_path = "t5-small"
data_path = "EdinburghNLP/xsum"
Framework used = Tensorflow, HugginFace T5 model

Concept Used:
  1. Transfer Learning
  2. Fine tuning LLMs


Due to limited resources, i used small portions of data and ran my model for just 5 epochs.
Ideally, huge data is required , and some fine tuning like Sequence Lenght, vocab size, learning rate and metrics needs to be looked after.

For now, i got decent results, about loss: 0.8.

Thanks
