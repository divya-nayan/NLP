It's an Language Translation problem where i've tried to implement the Transformer model from scratch.
Using Tensorflow, i've implemented the concepts of transformes for the English to French translation.
Major parts of a transformer architecture would be:
  A. Positional Encoding
  B. Padding Mask
  C. Look Ahead Mask
  D. Self Attention
  E. Multi Head Attention
  F. Encoder
  G. Decoder
  H. Transformer
